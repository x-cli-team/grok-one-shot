# 🧪 Plan Mode Implementation Testing Guide

## Objective

Comprehensive testing protocol for the newly implemented Plan Mode feature to ensure Claude Code parity and functionality.

## Test Overview

Plan Mode is Grok CLI's implementation of Claude Code's signature read-only exploration feature. This test validates:

- **Activation mechanism** (Shift+Tab twice)
- **Codebase exploration** functionality
- **AI-powered plan generation**
- **Read-only tool execution**
- **User approval workflow**
- **Phase transitions and UI feedback**

## 📋 Test Protocols

### Phase 1: Activation Testing

#### Test 1.1: Plan Mode Activation

**Objective**: Verify Shift+Tab twice activates Plan Mode

**Steps**:

1. Start Grok CLI in any project directory
2. Wait for normal prompt to appear
3. Press `Shift+Tab` once (should toggle auto-edit mode)
4. Within 2 seconds, press `Shift+Tab` again
5. Observe Plan Mode activation message

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan Mode activation message appears
- ✅ Plan Mode indicator shows "Analysis" phase
- ✅ Auto-exploration begins automatically
- ✅ UI shows Plan Mode status in status bar

#### Test 1.2: Plan Mode Deactivation

**Objective**: Verify Plan Mode can be exited

**Steps**:

1. Activate Plan Mode (Test 1.1)
2. Press `Shift+Tab` twice again while in Plan Mode
3. Observe deactivation message

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan Mode deactivation message appears
- ✅ Status bar returns to normal mode
- ✅ Plan Mode indicator disappears

### Phase 2: Exploration Testing

#### Test 2.1: Codebase Analysis

**Objective**: Verify automatic codebase exploration

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to a TypeScript/JavaScript project (preferably this Grok CLI project)
2. Activate Plan Mode
3. Wait for exploration to complete
4. Observe progress indicators and final results

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Progress indicator shows exploration progress
- ✅ Exploration completes within 15 seconds
- ✅ No file modifications occur during exploration
- ✅ Analysis phase transitions to strategy phase

#### Test 2.2: Project Structure Detection

**Objective**: Verify accurate project analysis

**Test Command**: After Plan Mode activation, ask:

```
"What did you discover about this project's structure?"
```

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Correctly identifies project type (Node.js/TypeScript CLI)
- ✅ Lists main directories (src/, .agent/, etc.)
- ✅ Identifies primary language as TypeScript
- ✅ Detects configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- ✅ Reports file count and project complexity

### Phase 3: Plan Generation Testing

#### Test 3.1: Simple Implementation Request

**Objective**: Test AI-powered plan generation

**Test Command**: While in Plan Mode, request:

```
"Add a new slash command called /status that shows the current Plan Mode state"
```

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan generation begins (strategy phase)
- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan is generated
- ✅ Plan includes specific steps with effort estimates
- ✅ Risk assessment is provided
- ✅ Timeline projection is included
- ✅ UI transitions to presentation phase

#### Test 3.2: Complex Implementation Request

**Objective**: Test planning for complex features

**Test Command**: While in Plan Mode, request:

```
"Implement a new tool that can automatically refactor TypeScript files to use modern syntax"
```

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan acknowledges complexity appropriately
- ✅ Breaks down into logical implementation steps
- ✅ Identifies dependencies and prerequisites
- ✅ Provides realistic effort estimates (higher hours)
- ✅ Highlights potential risks and challenges

### Phase 4: Read-Only Tool Testing

#### Test 4.1: Safe Tool Execution

**Objective**: Verify read-only tools work normally

**Test Commands**: While in Plan Mode, try:

```
"Show me the contents of package.json"
"List all TypeScript files in the src directory"
"Search for 'Plan Mode' in the codebase"
```

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Read operations execute normally
- ✅ File contents are displayed correctly
- ✅ Search results are accurate
- ✅ No modification attempts are made

#### Test 4.2: Destructive Tool Blocking

**Objective**: Verify destructive operations are blocked

**Test Commands**: While in Plan Mode, try:

```
"Create a new file called test.md with hello world content"
"Edit the package.json to add a new dependency"
"Delete the temp directory"
```

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Write/edit operations are blocked
- ✅ Simulation results are provided instead
- ✅ Explanation of what would have happened
- ✅ No actual file modifications occur
- ✅ Insights about the attempted operations

#### Test 4.3: Bash Command Safety

**Objective**: Test bash command filtering

**Test Commands**: While in Plan Mode, try:

```
"Run 'ls -la' to see directory contents"
"Execute 'rm temp.txt' to clean up"
"Run 'git status' to check repository state"
```

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Safe commands (ls, git status) execute normally
- ✅ Destructive commands (rm) are blocked and simulated
- ✅ Command categorization is accurate
- ✅ Risk assessment is provided

### Phase 5: UI and Integration Testing

#### Test 5.1: Visual Indicators

**Objective**: Verify Plan Mode UI elements

**Steps**:

1. Activate Plan Mode
2. Observe all UI elements throughout the workflow
3. Check status bar, progress indicators, and phase displays

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan Mode status appears in status bar
- ✅ Detailed plan mode indicator shows current phase
- ✅ Progress bars update during exploration
- ✅ Phase transitions are visually clear
- ✅ Session duration is tracked and displayed

#### Test 5.2: Chat Integration

**Objective**: Verify Plan Mode integrates with chat history

**Steps**:

1. Use Plan Mode for several operations
2. Check chat history for proper logging
3. Verify message formatting and clarity

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan Mode activation/deactivation logged
- ✅ Exploration progress updates appear
- ✅ Plan generation results are formatted clearly
- ✅ Tool execution results are properly categorized

### Phase 6: Error Handling Testing

#### Test 6.1: Invalid Project Directory

**Objective**: Test Plan Mode in non-project directories

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to a directory without project files (e.g., /tmp)
2. Activate Plan Mode
3. Observe behavior and error handling

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Plan Mode activates without errors
- ✅ Exploration completes with minimal findings
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing project structure
- ✅ Appropriate messaging about limited analysis

#### Test 6.2: Large Project Handling

**Objective**: Test performance with large codebases

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to a large project (if available)
2. Activate Plan Mode
3. Monitor performance and completion

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Exploration completes within reasonable time
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable
- ✅ Progress indicators update appropriately
- ✅ Results are comprehensive despite size
